#)what is elasticSearch?
Elasticsearch in Liferay is the default search engine used to index and search all portal content.

#)How can you apply Elasticsearch in a custom entity?
1)First, create a custom entity using Service Builder and define all required fields inside service.xml.
2)Next, in the same Service Builder module, create a new package and inside it, create an Indexer class for that entity.
3)In the Indexer class, choose which entity fields to index (as defined in service.xml) so Elasticsearch can search them efficiently.
4)Enable permission-aware search in the constructor so Elasticsearch returns only records the user is allowed to view.
5)Override important methods like:
-)doGetDocument() → to add fields into the index
-)doGetSummary() → to show summary in search results
-)doReindex() → to support reindexing
-)doDelete() → to remove data from the index when a record is deleted
After deploying the module, Liferay automatically indexes the entity in Elasticsearch whenever a record is added, updated, or deleted.
