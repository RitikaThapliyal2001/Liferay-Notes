For document-expiry notifications,
I create a scheduler using Liferay Dispatch Framework.
I implement a custom DispatchTaskExecutor where I fetch folders, check expired documents, and send notifications.
Then in @Activate, I programmatically create a DispatchTrigger with a cron expression so that the task runs daily. 
The scheduler runs independently of portal restarts and can be fully managed from the Liferay UI.
