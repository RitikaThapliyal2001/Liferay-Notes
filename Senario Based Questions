Question:-)You need to trigger an API call to an external system whenever a Liferay Object entry is created. What approach will you use?
Answer:-)I will use an Object Action with a Groovy script or a REST trigger.
When the Object entry is created, the Object Action will automatically call the external API.
If I need more complex logic, I will create a custom Java Object Action using a Model Listener.

1️⃣ Object Action (No Code — Recommended)
Liferay Objects support Object Actions that run when:
An entry is added
Updated
Deleted
You can configure an action:
✔ Condition: On After Create
✔ Type: Webhook
✔ URL: external system API
✔ Method: POST / PUT
✔ Body: JSON payload from the Object fields
This automatically calls the external API whenever an entry is created.
