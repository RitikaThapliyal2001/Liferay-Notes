A Model Listener in Liferay is a component that allows us to execute custom code whenever a
model’s lifecycle event occurs. It automatically triggers before or after actions like create
, update, or delete of any Liferay entity. By extending BaseModelListener and overriding methods
like onBeforeCreate or onAfterUpdate, we can add custom validation, logging, permissions,
or integration logic without changing the core service code.”

Service Wrapper is used when I want to modify or extend Liferay's
built-in service behavior.
I extend the existing LocalService/Service wrapper 
and override the desired method, adding my custom
logic before or after the core logic. This approach is upgrade-safe and avoids modifying core Liferay code.”
