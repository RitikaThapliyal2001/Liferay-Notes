Service Wrapper:
Service wrapper is used to wrap and overide the default services in liferay without effecting its core code
Example -UserLocalServiceWrapper – to customize user creation, update, validation
         DLFileEntryLocalServiceWrapper – to add logic while uploading or updating documents

Modle Listner:
Model Listener in Liferay is used to listen to model lifecycle events such as create,
update, and delete by implementing specific callback methods like onBeforeCreate, onAfterUpdate, and onAfterRemove

The differnce between Service Wrapper and Modle listner is 
Service Wrapper works at the service method level, while Model Listener works at the model lifecycle event level.
