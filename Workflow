WorkFlow?
Workflow means the sequence of states through which content passes from creation to publication. 
Liferay uses the Kaleo Workflow Engine to manage these approval processes.
When workflow is enabled, the content does not publish directly — instead, 
it first goes into the Pending state by default until it is reviewed and approved
