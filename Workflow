WorkFlow?
Workflow means the sequence of states through which content passes from creation to publication. 
Liferay uses the Kaleo Workflow Engine.
It allows organizations to:
Approve content before publishing
Assign review tasks to roles
Track who approved what
Maintain compliance and quality control
WorkflowTaskManagerUtil.assignWorkflowTaskToUser(
                        uploader.getCompanyId(),
                        uploaderUserId,
                        latestTask.getWorkflowTaskId(),
                        departmentHead.getUserId(),
                        commentStatus,
                        null,
                        new HashMap<>()
                );
 
   WorkflowTaskManagerUtil.getWorkflowTasksByUser(
                        uploader.getCompanyId(),
                        uploaderUserId,  // initiator
                        false,           // pending only
                        QueryUtil.ALL_POS, // start
                        QueryUtil.ALL_POS, // end         
                        null
                );
it first goes into the Pending state by default until it is reviewed and approved
