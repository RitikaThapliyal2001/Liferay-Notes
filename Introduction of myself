Hi everyone, my name is Ritika Thapliyal.
I am a Liferay backend developer at Giks India Pvt. Ltd.
currently based in Dehradun.
I have around 3 years of experience in Liferay development, mainly focusing on backend systems.
I have worked on multiple Projects such as NBP and NHO,
Where I was responsible for end-to-end backend development.
My experience includes working with Liferay Objects, Service Builder, Custom APIs, REST Builder, Document & Media, Roles & Permissions,
