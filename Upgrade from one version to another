1-)Check Official Documentation
✅ Always start by reading the official Liferay upgrade guides on learn.liferay.com
It tells you about breaking changes, deprecated APIs, new features, and required steps.

2-)Take Full Backup
✅ Backup your database and code (all modules, services, and customizations).
This is critical because if something breaks during upgrade, you can roll back.

3-)After then i will change in 
liferay.workspace.product=<new-version> in which i want to updgrade
This tells Gradle which Liferay version to use.

4-)Check for Breaking Changes
After changing the version, run gradle build and check for errors in your modules, service APIs, and custom code.
Update your code to handle any API changes, deprecated methods, or breaking changes mentioned in the Liferay upgrade guide.

5-)Update Database Schema
Add the line in portal-ext.properties:
update.database.auto.run=true
When you start Liferay, it will automatically update database schemas, and indexes.

✅ Make sure to check logs for any database errors.

Once the server is up, thoroughly test your modules, customizations, workflows, and services.
Check for UI changes, new features, or deprecated behavior that may affect your project
