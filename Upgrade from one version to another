“When we upgrade Liferay from one version to another, we follow a structured migration process.

First, we update the target product version in gradle.properties, for example:
liferay.workspace.product=dxp-2025.q1.4-lts.
This applies the required ‘unbreakable changes’ for that version.

Then we update and resolve all module-level dependencies (OSGi, third-party libraries, and Liferay APIs) so everything aligns with the new DXP version.

After the codebase is aligned, we prepare for the database upgrade.
We enable:
upgrade.database.auto.run=true
so that Liferay runs all required Upgrade Processes automatically.

When the server starts, Liferay executes the upgrade steps, verifies schema changes, updates module versions, and completes the database migration.

Overall, the upgrade process is:
Update product version → Apply unbreakable changes → Resolve dependencies → Run automatic database + module upgrades.”**
